## Introduction

Spotify Artists module connects to the Spotify API.
An administrator is able to save up to 20 Spotify artist ids.
A list of these artistsâ€™ names will be displayed in a block.
When logged in, each name will link to a page on the website
showing more information about that artist.
This artist page should only be visible to logged-in users.

## Requirements

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.

## Installation

1. Extract 'spotify_artists' folder into Drupal's custom
module folder (modules/custom).
2. Enable the module. You may use this drush command:
`drush en spotify_artists`
